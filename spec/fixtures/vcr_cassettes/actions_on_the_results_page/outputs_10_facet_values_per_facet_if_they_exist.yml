        characteristic theme of the works of Stone is the bridge between culture and
        society. Several narratives concerning the fatal !aw, and subsequent dialectic,
        of semioticist class may be found.\nThus, Debord uses the term \u2018the subtextual
        paradigm of consensus\u2019 to denote a cultural paradox. The subject is interpolated
        into a neocultural discourse that includes sexuality as a totality.\nBut Marx\u2019s
        critique of prepatriarchialist nihilism states that consciousness is capable
        of signi\"cance. The main theme of Dietrich\u2019s[1]model of cultural discourse
        is not construction, but neoconstruction.\nThus, any number of narratives
        concerning the textual paradigm of narrative exist. Pretextual cultural theory
        suggests that context must come from the collective unconscious.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.5555\/12345678","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,11,9]],"date-time":"2011-11-09T14:42:05Z","timestamp":1320849725000},"page":"1-3","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.5555\/something","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Toward

        chapter examines Edward VI''s accession to the throne in 1547 at the age of
        nine following the death of his father, Henry VIII. The weight of evangelical
        expectation resting on Edward''s shoulders was made plain to him at his coronation
        on 20 February. A much quoted address on the occasion by Archbishop Thomas
        Cranmer \u2014 in which he hailed the young king as \u2018a second Josiah\u2019,
        the King of Judah who succeeded his father at the age of eight, and as a young
        adult destroyed altars and images erected to the worship of Baal \u2014 is
        a clever late-seventeenth-century forgery. The chapter discusses the changes
        and problems that marked Edward''s reign, focusing on issues relating to royal
        visitation, the nature of the eucharist, liturgy and the introduction of a
        new Prayer Book, and the heresy of the anabaptists.<\/p>","DOI":"10.12987\/yale\/9780300170627.003.0010","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,23]],"date-time":"2018-01-23T09:11:05Z","timestamp":1516698665000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Josiah"],"prefix":"10.12987","author":[{"given":"Peter","family":"Marshall","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"5164","container-title":["Yale
