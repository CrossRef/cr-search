        characteristic theme of the works of Stone is the bridge between culture and
        society. Several narratives concerning the fatal !aw, and subsequent dialectic,
        of semioticist class may be found.\nThus, Debord uses the term \u2018the subtextual
        paradigm of consensus\u2019 to denote a cultural paradox. The subject is interpolated
        into a neocultural discourse that includes sexuality as a totality.\nBut Marx\u2019s
        critique of prepatriarchialist nihilism states that consciousness is capable
        of signi\"cance. The main theme of Dietrich\u2019s[1]model of cultural discourse
        is not construction, but neoconstruction.\nThus, any number of narratives
        concerning the textual paradigm of narrative exist. Pretextual cultural theory
        suggests that context must come from the collective unconscious.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.5555\/12345678","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,11,9]],"date-time":"2011-11-09T14:42:05Z","timestamp":1320849725000},"page":"1-3","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.5555\/something","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Toward
